  They take 15% less Slash and 25% less Piercing damage,
  but take 50% more Blunt and 50% more Heat damage.

  They are immune to Radiation and Cold Damage.

  They don't have blood and cannot bleed out.

  They don't experience hunger or thirst.

  They come with an envirosuit helmet that provides a flashlight and welding protection.

  Due to being skeletons, they can consume Milk to gain a positive moodlet and slowly heal Brute, Heat, Shock, and Caustic damage.

  They can consume Plasma to gain a bigger positive moodlet and heal every damage type faster than Milk, except Cellular.

  They can only breathe plasma, and oxygen is highly toxic when inhaled.

  Being exposed to oxygen sets them on fire, forcing them to wear envirosuits, EVA suits or hardsuits.

  They cannot eat, drink, or consume pills without taking off their envirosuit helmet.
